## Overview

This repository provides guides, configuration examples, and best practices for setting up Splunk Universal Forwarders, Splunk Enterprise Indexers, and custom dashboards to gain real-time insights into game performance, player behavior, and infrastructure health.

---

## Prerequisites

- Gaming server environment (cloud or on-premises)
- Access to Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Observability Cloud
- Hardware and OS requirements met for Splunk components
- Required Splunk licenses
- Permissions to install software on game servers

---

## Setup Guide

### 1. Installing Splunk Universal Forwarders

- Download and install the Universal Forwarder on each game server.
- [Splunk UF Download](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html)
- Example (Linux):

  ```sh
  wget -O splunkforwarder.tgz 'https://...'
  tar -xvf splunkforwarder.tgz
  cd splunkforwarder
  ./splunk start --accept-license
  ```

### 2. Configuring Forwarders

- Configure `inputs.conf` to monitor:
  - Game server logs
  - In-game event logs/telemetry
  - System metrics

  Example `inputs.conf`:

  ```
  [monitor:///var/log/game-server/*.log]
  disabled = false
  sourcetype = game-server-log

  [monitor:///var/log/game-events/*.log]
  disabled = false
  sourcetype = game-event-log
  ```

- Secure the forwarder with SSL/TLS (recommended).

### 3. Setting Up Splunk Enterprise Indexers

- Install Splunk Enterprise on dedicated servers.
- Configure `indexes.conf` for your game data:

  ```
  [game_server]
  homePath = $SPLUNK_DB/game_server/db
  coldPath = $SPLUNK_DB/game_server/colddb
  thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/game_server/thaweddb
  ```

- Set up indexer clustering if high availability is required.

### 4. Connecting Forwarders to Indexers

- Update `outputs.conf` on the Universal Forwarder to point to indexer(s):

  ```
  [tcpout]
  defaultGroup = default-indexers

  [tcpout:default-indexers]
  server = <indexer-ip>:9997
  ```

### 5. Server-Side Observability

- Monitor system metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, network).
- Collect server logs and error files.
- Use Splunk Add-ons or scripts for enhanced metric collection.

### 6. In-Game Observability

- Log key in-game events (player actions, errors, performance metrics).
- Ensure logs are structured (JSON, CSV) for easy parsing.
- Forward logs to Splunk via files or direct API calls.

### 7. (Optional) Splunk Observability Cloud Integration

- Install the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for advanced metrics/APM.
- Configure to send telemetry data to Splunk Observability Cloud.

## Dashboards and Alerts

- Use provided dashboard examples to visualize:
  - Player activity
  - Server health
  - Error rates
  - Performance bottlenecks
- Set up real-time alerts for:
  - High latency
  - Crash spikes
  - Unusual in-game events

---

## Troubleshooting

- Universal Forwarder not sending data? Check splunkd.log.
- Data not appearing in Splunk? Verify index and sourcetype configuration.
- Performance issues? Review hardware specs and indexer clustering.
