## Overview

Dashboards provide a visual overview of the health, activity, and issues within your gaming environment. Properly designed dashboards help you quickly identify problems, spot trends, and make informed decisions.

---

## Best Practices

- Use consistent color schemes and naming conventions.
- Group related panels together (e.g., all latency panels in one row).
- Include time selectors for flexible analysis.
- Annotate panels with descriptions for context.
- Use summary statistics (single value panels) at the top.

---

## Server-Side Dashboards

### System Health

**Panels to Include:**
- CPU Usage (%) per server
- Memory Usage (%) per server
- Disk I/O and Usage
- Top Processes by Resource Consumption

**Sample SPL:**
```spl
index=game_server sourcetype=system_metrics
| stats avg(cpu_usage) as "CPU %" avg(mem_usage) as "Memory %" by host
```

---

### Network Performance

**Panels to Include:**
- Average Latency (ms)
- Packet Loss (%) per server
- Network Throughput (Mbps)

**Sample SPL:**
```spl
index=game_server sourcetype=network_metrics
| timechart avg(latency_ms) as "Latency (ms)", avg(packet_loss) as "Packet Loss (%)" by host
```

---

### Error and Crash Monitoring

**Panels to Include:**
- Error Count Over Time
- Recent Crash Logs
- Top Error Types

**Sample SPL:**
```spl
index=game_server sourcetype=server_logs error OR exception OR crash
| timechart count by error_type
```

---

## In-Game Observability Dashboards

### Player Activity

**Panels to Include:**
- Active Players Over Time
- Player Logins/Logouts
- Geographic Distribution of Players

**Sample SPL:**
```spl
index=game_events event_type=player_login OR event_type=player_logout
| timechart count by event_type
```

---

### Match/Session Stats

**Panels to Include:**
- Ongoing Matches/Sessions
- Average Session Duration
- Most Played Maps/Modes

**Sample SPL:**
```spl
index=game_events event_type=match_start OR event_type=match_end
| transaction player_id startswith=event_type="match_start" endswith=event_type="match_end"
| stats avg(duration) as "Avg Match Duration"
```

---

### In-Game Errors and Events

**Panels to Include:**
- Error Frequency by Type
- High-Latency Events
- Unusual In-Game Events (e.g., exploits, disconnects)

**Sample SPL:**
```spl
index=game_events event_type=error
| stats count by error_code, map_name
```

---

## Custom Dashboard Examples

### Example: Player Experience Overview

- **Panels:**  
  - Concurrent Players  
  - Login Failures  
  - Average In-Game Latency  
  - Top Reported Bugs (from player feedback logs)

### Example: Server Performance Overview

- **Panels:**  
  - CPU & Memory Usage (all servers, time-series)  
  - Network Traffic (Mbps)  
  - Top Crash/Error Types  
  - Active vs. Idle Game Servers

---

## Dashboard Setup Tips

- Use Splunkâ€™s Dashboard Studio for flexible layouts and visuals.
- Use tokens and dropdowns for filtering by server, region, or map.
- Schedule dashboard updates for real-time monitoring.
- Export dashboard JSON/XML for version control.
