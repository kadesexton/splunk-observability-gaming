## Overview

Deploying observability for gaming servers with Splunk involves several components. Use the steps below to quickly isolate and resolve common issues.

---

## Forwarder Issues

### Forwarder Not Sending Data

- **Check Splunkd Log:**  
  Look for errors in `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log`.
- **Verify Forward Server Configuration:**  
  Run `./bin/splunk list forward-server` to confirm the indexer address and status.
- **Restart Forwarder:**  
  Sometimes a restart resolves connection issues:  
  `./bin/splunk restart`
- **Firewall/Network:**  
  Ensure outbound traffic on port 9997 (default) is allowed.

---

### Permission Errors

- **Symptoms:**  
  Forwarder logs show "permission denied" errors or missing monitored files.
- **Solutions:**  
  - Run the forwarder as a user with read access to game server log files.
  - Check file and directory permissions for monitored paths.

---

### Network Connectivity Issues

- **Symptoms:**  
  Forwarder cannot connect to indexer; "connection refused" or "timed out" errors.
- **Solutions:**  
  - Check `outputs.conf` for correct indexer IP/port.
  - Verify that the indexer is listening on port 9997.
  - Test connectivity with `telnet <indexer-ip> 9997` or `nc -vz <indexer-ip> 9997`.

---

## Indexer Issues

### Indexer Not Receiving Data

- **Check Listener:**  
  Ensure the indexer is configured to receive data (`Settings > Forwarding and Receiving > Configure Receiving`).
- **Review splunkd.log:**  
  Look for errors or warnings related to receiving data.
- **Monitor Forwarded Data:**  
  Use the search: `index=* | stats count by host` to see if data from your game server is arriving.

---

### Indexer High Resource Usage

- **Symptoms:**  
  Splunk Web is slow, searches time out, or indexer hardware is maxed out.
- **Solutions:**  
  - Review hardware capacity (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O).
  - Check for unusually large or verbose logs.
  - Consider indexer clustering for load balancing.

---

## Data & Dashboard Issues

### No Data in Dashboards

- **Check Index and Sourcetype:**  
  Make sure your searches use the correct index and sourcetype.
- **Verify Time Range:**  
  Ensure dashboard time pickers include the period when data should be present.
- **Validate Forwarder and Indexer Health:**  
  Confirm data is arriving (see above).

---

### Data Parsing Issues

- **Symptoms:**  
  Field extractions don’t work, data is not structured or searchable.
- **Solutions:**  
  - Review and update field extractions for your log format.
  - Use Splunk’s Field Extractor or `props.conf`/`transforms.conf` as needed.

---

### Missing or Incorrect Panels

- **Symptoms:**  
  Dashboard panels are empty or showing incorrect values.
- **Solutions:**  
  - Check SPL queries for errors or typos.
  - Confirm indexes and sourcetypes are correct.
  - Ensure required fields are present in the ingested data.

---

## In-Game Event Troubleshooting

- **Logs Not Forwarded:**  
  - Confirm game server logs/events are being written to disk.
  - Validate `inputs.conf` is monitoring the correct log paths.
- **Events Missing in Splunk:**  
  - Check for log rotation or file permission issues.
  - Look for filtering rules that may drop certain events.

---

## General Diagnostic Commands

- **Check Forwarder Status:**  
  `./bin/splunk status`
- **List Monitored Files:**  
  `./bin/splunk list monitor`
- **Show Forwarded Servers:**  
  `./bin/splunk list forward-server`
- **Search for Data:**  
  In Splunk Web:  
  `index=* host=<game-server-host>`
